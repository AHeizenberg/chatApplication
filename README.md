# Online Chat Application
The following is an online chat application that I created using JS, HTML & CSS. The application consists of a frontend that I build using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla JS. Moreover, there is a client side and server side that I build using Node.js and Express.js.

## Environment Setup
Run the following command on the terminal for the proper environment setup. This should read the included package.json file and download all the needed packages.

    npm install

Moreover, please ensure that your system has Node.js installed.

## How to compile my code:
Run the following command on the terminal in order to compile and start the server. Once this command is executed the server will be started on port 3000.

     node server/server.js

Once the server has started you can type http://localhost:3000 in your browser and the client-side page should load. It will initially show a login screen in which you can type the username and pick a color using the HTML color element. Here if your name is not unique the server will assign you a random name that can be changed later.

<b>Note:</b> I am using bootstrap5 for my assignment by adding the appropriate style tag and script tag to my index.html file so when using my project please make sure you are connected to the internet so that bootstrap5 can perform as expected.
